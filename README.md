# Car-Image-Diffusion-Model
Implementation of a Diffusion Model for generating car images, utilizing a simplified U-Net architecture and trained on the Stanford Cars Dataset.

This repository contains a Python notebook demonstrating the implementation of a Diffusion Model for generating realistic car images. The project leverages the Stanford Cars Dataset to train a generative model capable of synthesizing new images that resemble those in the dataset.

Key Components:

Diffusion Process: Exploration of the forward (noise addition) and backward (denoising) diffusion steps.

Neural Network: Implementation of a simplified U-Net model as the core of the diffusion model to learn the denoising process.

Training: Code for training the diffusion model on the Stanford Cars Dataset.

Image Generation: Functions for sampling and generating new images from random noise using the trained model.

This project serves as a practical example of applying diffusion models to the task of image generation, specifically focused on the domain of car images.
